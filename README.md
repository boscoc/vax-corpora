# vax-corpora
The github contains an Italian and a French corpus from Twitter about the anti-Covid vaccination. 
In the Italian corpus, called VAX-stanceITA, each tweet is associated with its stance manually annotated using a scheme that includes 3 labels (pro, contro, neutro).
The French corpus, called VAX-FRE, includes only tweets without annotation.
